# Changelog

### v1.0.1 (2026-11-05)
* **Internal:** the tests never sign the git commits and tags they make in their own repositories, so they pass where the global git config signs every commit and no passphrase is at hand

### v1.0.0 (2026-11-05)
* **Repo:** the first public release. Earlier versions were private and are not published; a panel on an earlier version updates to this one from its Updates page, and nothing changes in its setup
* **Sites:** every WordPress site on this machine at a glance, made by the panel or by hand: health, certificate, WordPress core, git branch, database, logs and how each site came here
* **Sites:** the new site wizard builds a site from a git repo and a database dump, a fresh WordPress, an empty folder or your GitHub organization, multisite and sites under a path of another site included
* **Sites:** SSL from a local CA, trusted in the system, Chrome, Edge and Firefox; Apache vhosts with the panel's marker and one marked block in `/etc/hosts`, while vhosts and hosts lines you made by hand stay as they are
* **Sites:** shared WordPress cores through `wpcore`, Local mode (mail to Mailpit, no indexing, logins from this computer only) and one-click wp-admin login, cache clearing, rewrite rules, debug settings, branches and pull
* **Panel:** databases with snapshots, restore, dump import, search and replace with a preview, and clean copies for the team without users, orders or keys
* **Panel:** PHP versions, modules and settings per version, and a PHP of its own for a site through PHP-FPM; Apache, MySQL and Mailpit on the Services pages
* **Panel:** Aura lists every problem on your sites and this machine with one-click fixes; removed or replaced sites stay in the Archive for 14 days, and system files are backed up before every change
* **Panel:** updates without a token, through public HTTPS, the GitHub CLI or git over SSH; light and dark themes, a phone-friendly layout, localhost only
* **AI:** an optional assistant with a briefing, a chat and an MCP server for Claude Code, where every change comes back as a card you run
* **Installer:** `get.sh` and `install.sh` with a dry run that prints every change, an uninstall that asks before it removes what you might keep, and a rollback when an update fails
